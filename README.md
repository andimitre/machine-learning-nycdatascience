Linear regression on any stock.

To run as a commandline application  
  1) install the following:  `pip install beautifulsoup pandas matplotlib sklearn`  
  2) run the script passing a command line arg(pass any stock ticker, I've used Amazon's ticker below 'AMZN'):  
  `python stock_analysis.py AMZN`  
  
**the script will out put accuracy of the model along with a graph ui
